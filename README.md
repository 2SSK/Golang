## Basic Refresher

### FizzBuzz Implementation

- Write a program that prints number from 1 to 100
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
- For numbres which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

### Palindrome Checker

- Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

### Reverse a Slice

- Create a function to reverse a slice of integers.

---

## Intermediate Challenges

### File Reader

- Write a program that reads a text filde line by line and prints each line.

### Prime Number Finder

- Write a function that finds all prime numbers less than n.

### Simple CLI Calculator

- Build a CLI calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### JSON Parsing

- Parse a JSON file containing an array of user data(e.g., name, age, email) and print the data in a readable format.

### Concurrency Practice

- Create a program that calculates the factorial of multiple numbers Concurrently.

---

## Advance Projects

### HTTP Server

- Build a simple HTTP server that handles basic routes (e.g., `/`, `/hello`).
- Return JSON responses for certain routes.

### Todo CLI App (Revisit)

- Extend your previous todo CLI app:
  - Add features like data persistence using a file or database.
  - Allow filtering by status (e.g., completed, pending).

### URL Shortener

- Create URL shortener application.
- Use a map to store the short and long URL pairs.

### Goroutine Worker Pool

- Write a worker pool program that processes a list of jobs using goroutines.

---

## Algoritms Challenges

### Merge Sorted Arrays

- Write a function to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

### Binary Search

- Implement a binary search function for a sorted slice.

### Matrix Multiplication

- Write a function to multiply two matrices.

### Word Frequency Counter

- Write a program that counts the frequency of each word in a given text file.

---

## Go-Specific Features

### Channels and Goroutines

- Implement a producer-consumer problem using channels.
- Simulate an environment where producers and consumers add items to a queue, and consumers process them.

### Interfaces

- Create a interface for a geometric shape with methods for calculating area and perimeter. Implement this interface for circle and Rectangle.

### Error Handling

- Build a function that simulates an operation(like division) and returns an error when an invalid operation occurs.

### Go Modules

- Create a small project with multiple packages. Learn how to initialize and use Go modules effictively.
